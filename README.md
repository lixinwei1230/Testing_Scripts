# Testing_Scripts
This is basically my testing courses homework

I wrote many script using python to test the website automatically. The goal of each ICA is in pdf in each ICA folders. 

Basically I implemented black-box testing using Crawljax, Selenium. White-Box testing using my professor's tools named wam. And use Cucumber to implement bahavior driven testing. As for the Fault_Localization and Formal_Verification, it's very hard to implement but very interesting. I used Tarantula to localize the fault and it is automated as a whole. When I worte the Control flow graph code, it took me a lot of time of modifying my code, but I quite enjoy the whole process. At last, I implemented Regression testing using DejaVu method.

After taking the testing course. I learned many method and concept of software testing and get huge interest in that field.

After construct the CFG, I put all the statement into a two dimentional array using a loop. So the CFG is build. And then I use the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to calculate the reachibility, after that
, I can easily calculate the two invokes are reachible or not by  looking at the result of the two-dimention array. If the result bigger than 0, then it's reachible, vice versa.

1 The faults_found.txt are the faults(test report) I found and reported in the file, there ten faults I found from the diff.txt

2 the log file is created in the class named localhost_access_log.2015-10-07.txt, it's the test suite I created.

3 And there are two parser written by python, one is for golden version and one is for the replay. I excuted the different bash file output by python parser to download the jsp file \
 into different folder and then use diff command to compare the different file. The diff.txt finally tells the difference between two version.

4 the coverage is 53% as I attached in the zip.
